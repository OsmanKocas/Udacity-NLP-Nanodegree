# Udacity-NLP-Nanodegree
This repository contains the projects I have complete for Udacity's NLP Nanodegree. Specifically,
  <p><bf> 1. Part of Speech Tagging </bf> : An implementation of HMM tagger</p>
  ** 2. Machine to machine Translation: ** Keras implementation of several Deep Learning Architectures for English to French translation model
  ** 3. Voice User Interfaces: ** Speech Recognition with Neural Networks where I implement several deep learning architectures for speech recognition.
